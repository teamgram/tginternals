# Discussion Widget

You can embed discussions from any public channel on your website. You only need a link to a post with comments to embed it together with all discussion.

If you have a website with articles and a telegram channel where you post links to these articles, you can use this widget to show discussions from that channel on your website. In this case you only need a link to the channel. Discussions will be available on your website as soon as you post a link into the channel. For this to work, you should add the <link rel="canonical" href="%page_url%"> tag to the page header where %page_url% is the canonical URL of the current page.

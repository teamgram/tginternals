Before a call is ready, some preliminary actions have to be performed. The calling party needs to contact the party to be called and check whether it is ready to accept the call. Besides that, the parties have to negotiate the protocols to be used, learn the IP addresses of each other or of the Telegram relay servers to be used (so-called reflectors), and generate a one-time encryption key for this voice call with the aid of Diffie--Hellman key exchange. All of this is accomplished in parallel with the aid of several Telegram API methods and related notifications. This document covers details related to key generation, encryption and security.

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange, as well as the whole protocol used to create a new voice call, is quite similar to the one used for Secret Chats. We recommend studying the linked article before proceeding.

However, we have introduced some important changes to facilitate the key verification process. Below is the entire exchange between the two communicating parties, the Caller (A) and the Callee (B), through the Telegram servers (S).

- A executes messages.getDhConfig to find out the 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman prime p and generator g. The client is expected to check whether p is a safe prime and perform all the security checks necessary for secret chats.

- A chooses a random value of a, 1 < a < p-1, and computes g_a:=power(g,a) mod p (a 256-byte number) and g_a_hash:=SHA256(g_a) (32 bytes long).

- A invokes (sends to server S) phone.requestCall, which has the field g_a_hash:bytes, among others. For this call, this field is to be filled with g_a_hash, not g_a itself.

- The Server S performs privacy checks and sends an updatePhoneCall update with a phoneCallRequested constructor to all of B's active devices. This update, apart from the identity of A and other relevant parameters, contains the g_a_hash field, filled with the value obtained from A.

- B accepts the call on one of their devices, stores the received value of g_a_hash for this instance of the voice call creation protocol, chooses a random value of b, 1 < b < p-1, computes g_b:=power(g,b) mod p, performs all the required security checks, and invokes the phone.acceptCall method, which has a g_b:bytes field (among others), to be filled with the value of g_b itself (not its hash).

- The Server S sends an updatePhoneCall with the phoneCallDiscarded constructor to all other devices B has authorized, to prevent accepting the same call on any of the other devices. From this point on, the server S works only with that of B's devices which has invoked phone.acceptCall first.

- The Server S sends to A an updatePhoneCall update with phoneCallAccepted constructor, containing the value of g_b received from B.

- A performs all the usual security checks on g_b and a, computes the Diffie--Hellman key key:=power(g_b,a) mod p and its fingerprint key_fingerprint:long, equal to the lower 64 bits of SHA1(key), the same as with secret chats. Then A invokes the phone.confirmCall method, containing g_a:bytes and key_fingerprint:long.

- The Server S sends to B an updatePhoneCall update with the phoneCall constructor, containing the value of g_a in g_a_or_b:bytes field, and key_fingerprint:long

- At this point B receives the value of g_a. It checks that SHA256(g_a) is indeed equal to the previously received value of g_a_hash, performs all the usual Diffie-Hellman security checks, and computes the key key:=power(g_a,b) mod p and its fingerprint, equal to the lower 64 bits of SHA1(key). Then it checks that this fingerprint equals the value of key_fingerprint:long received from the other side, as an implementation sanity check.

At this point, the Diffie--Hellman key exchange is complete, and both parties have a 256-byte shared secret key key which is used to encrypt all further exchanges between A and B.

It is of paramount importance to accept each update only once for each instance of the key generation protocol, discarding any duplicates or alternative versions of already received and processed messages (updates).

> This document describes encryption in voice and video calls as implemented in Telegram apps with versions 7.0 and above. See this document for details on encryption used in voice calls in app versions released before August 14, 2020.

The Telegram Voice and Video Call Library uses an optimized version of MTProto 2.0 to send and receive packets, consisting of one or more end-to-end encrypted messages of various types (ice candidates list, video formats, remote video status, audio stream data, video stream data, message ack or empty).

This document describes only the encryption process, leaving out encoding and network-dependent parts.

The library starts working with:

- An encryption key key shared between the parties, as generated above.

- Information whether the call is outgoing or incoming.

- Two data transfer channels: signaling, offered by the Telegram API, and transport based on WebRTC.

Both data transfer channels are unreliable (messages may get lost), but signaling is slower and more reliable.

### Encrypting Call Data

The body of a packet (decrypted_body) consists of several messages and their respective seq numbers concatenated together.

- decrypted_body = message_seq1 + message_body1 + message_seq2 + message_body2

Each decrypted_body is unique because no two seq numbers of the first message can be the same. If only old messages need to be re-sent, an empty message with new unique seq is added to the packet first.

The encryption key key is used to compute a 128-bit msg_key and then a 256-bit aes_key and a 128-bit aes_iv:

- msg_key_large = SHA256 (substr(key, 88+x, 32) + decrypted_body);

- msg_key = substr (msg_key_large, 8, 16);

- sha256_a = SHA256 (msg_key + substr (key, x, 36));

- sha256_b = SHA256 (substr (key, 40+x, 36) + msg_key);

- aes_key = substr (sha256_a, 0, 8) + substr (sha256_b, 8, 16) + substr (sha256_a, 24, 8);

- aes_iv = substr (sha256_b, 0, 4) + substr (sha256_a, 8, 8) + substr (sha256_b, 24, 4);

x depends on whether the call is outgoing or incoming and on the connection type:

- x = 0 for outgoing + transport

- x = 8 for incoming + transport

- x = 128 for outgoing + signaling

- x = 136 for incoming + signaling

This allows apps to decide which packet types will be sent to which connections and work in these connections independently (with each having its own seq counter).

The resulting aes_key and aes_iv are used to encrypt decrypted_body:

- encrypted_body = AES_CTR (decrypted_body, aes_key, aes_iv)

The packet that gets sent consists of msg_key and encrypted_body:

- packet_bytes = msg_key + encrypted_body

When received, the packet gets decrypted using key and msg_key, after which msg_key is checked against the relevant SHA256 substring. If the check fails, the packet must be discarded.

### Protecting Against Replay Attacks

Each of the peers maintains its own 32-bit monotonically increasing counter for outgoing messages, seq, starting with 1. This seq counter is prepended to each sent message and increased by 1 for each new message. No two seq numbers of the first message in a packet can be the same. If only old messages need to be re-sent, an empty message with a new unique seq is added to the packet first. When the seq counter reaches 2^30, the call must be aborted. Each peer stores seq values of all the messages it has received (and processed) which are larger than max_received_seq - 64, where max_received_seq is the largest seq number received so far.

If a packet is received, the first message of which has a seq that is smaller or equal to max_received_seq - 64 or its seq had already been received, the message is discarded. Otherwise, the seq values of all incoming messages are memorized and max_received_seq is adjusted. This guarantees that no two packets will be processed twice.

To verify the key, and ensure that no MITM attack is taking place, both parties concatenate the secret key key with the value g_a of the Caller ( A ), compute SHA256 and use it to generate a sequence of emoticons. More precisely, the SHA256 hash is split into four 64-bit integers; each of them is divided by the total number of emoticons used (currently 333), and the remainder is used to select specific emoticons. The specifics of the protocol guarantee that comparing four emoticons out of a set of 333 is sufficient to prevent eavesdropping (MiTM attack on DH) with a probability of 0.9999999999.

This is because instead of the standard Diffie-Hellman key exchange which requires only two messages between the parties:

- A->B : (generates a and) sends g_a := g^a

- B->A : (generates b and true key (g_a)^b, then) sends g_b := g^b

- A : computes key (g_b)^a

we use a three-message modification thereof that works well when both parties are online (which also happens to be a requirement for voice calls):

- A->B : (generates a and) sends g_a_hash := hash(g^a)

- B->A : (stores g_a_hash, generates b and) sends g_b := g^b

- A->B : (computes key (g_b)^a, then) sends g_a := g^a

- B : checks hash(g_a) == g_a_hash, then computes key (g_a)^b

The idea here is that A commits to a specific value of a (and of g_a) without disclosing it to B. B has to choose its value of b and g_b without knowing the true value of g_a, so that it cannot try different values of b to force the final key (g_a)^b to have any specific properties (such as fixed lower 32 bits of SHA256(key)). At this point, B commits to a specific value of g_b without knowing g_a. Then A has to send its value g_a; it cannot change it even though it knows g_b now, because the other party B would accept only a value of g_a that has a hash specified in the very first message of the exchange.

If some impostor is pretending to be either A or B and tries to perform a Man-in-the-Middle Attack on this Diffie--Hellman key exchange, the above still holds. Party A will generate a shared key with B -- or whoever pretends to be B -- without having a second chance to change its exponent a depending on the value g_b received from the other side; and the impostor will not have a chance to adapt his value of b depending on g_a, because it has to commit to a value of g_b before learning g_a. The same is valid for the key generation between the impostor and the party B.

The use of hash commitment in the DH exchange constrains the attacker to only one guess to generate the correct visualization in their attack, which means that using just over 33 bits of entropy represented by four emoji in the visualization is enough to make a successful attack highly improbable.

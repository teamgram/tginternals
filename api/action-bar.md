updatePeerSettings#6a7e7366 peer:Peer settings:PeerSettings = Update;

messages.peerSettings#6880b94d settings:PeerSettings chats:Vector<Chat> users:Vector<User> = messages.PeerSettings;

---functions---

messages.getPeerSettings#efd9a6a2 peer:InputPeer = messages.PeerSettings;

messages.hidePeerSettingsBar#4facb138 peer:InputPeer = Bool;
```

The action bar is represented by the peerSettings constructor, fetchable using messages.getPeerSettings; it is also contained in the userFull constructor returned by users.getFullUser.

Changes to the chat bar may also be notified by the server using updatePeerSettings.

The currently active action bar may also be dismissed using messages.hidePeerSettingsBar.

What follows is a list of the various (mutually exclusive) chat bar types, along with the condition used to identify each type, by checking the appropriate flags of peerSettings.

### Report spam, block or add contact

```
inputReportReasonSpam#58dbcab8 = ReportReason;

---functions---

account.reportPeer#c5ba3d86 peer:InputPeer reason:ReportReason message:string = Bool;

contacts.addContact#e8f463d0 flags:# add_phone_privacy_exception:flags.0?true id:InputUser first_name:string last_name:string phone:string = Updates;

contacts.block#2e2e8734 flags:# my_stories_from:flags.0?true id:InputPeer = Bool;
```

This action bar, associated to a private or secret chat, offers the user buttons to:

- Report the chat for spam using account.reportPeer and inputReportReasonSpam.

- If the other user has an emoji status, then the bar should also show a notice, indicating that the emoji status is shown next to the user's name because they have purchased Telegram Premium (i.e. this is useful to avoid issues if the user uses an emoji status similar to a verified checkmark).

- Additionally, if the chat was automatically archived » (according to peerSettings.autoarchived), an extra button can be shown to unarchive the chat as specified here » instead of reporting it.

- Add the other user of the chat to the contact list using contacts.addContact.

- Optionally, the peerSettings.need_contacts_exception flag may also be set: if so, the add_phone_privacy_exception flag must be set if the user clicks on the add contact button, invoking contacts.addContact.

- Block the other user of the chat from writing to us using contacts.block (without setting the my_stories_from flag).

Condition: the peerSettings.report_spam, peerSettings.add_contact, peerSettings.block_contact flags must all be set.

Additionally, if the peerSettings.geo_distance flag is set, the bar should also display the distance between us and the user, indicating that the user found us by invoking contacts.getLocated, because we are currently advertising our location with the same method.

```

When a user contacts you for the first time, the registration_month, phone_country, name_change_date and photo_change_date flags will be set in their peerSettings constructor: these fields should be used to generate an info box, containing the following information:

- registration_month - Used to display the user's registration year and month, the string is in MM.YYYY format, where MM is the registration month (1-12), and YYYY is the registration year.

- phone_country - The country code of the user's phone number.

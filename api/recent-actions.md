# Admin log
Both supergroups and channels offer a so-called admin log, a log of recent relevant supergroup and channel actions, like the modification of group/channel settings or information on behalf of an admin, user kicks and bans, and more.
channels.getAdminLog can be used to list recent admin activity.
A channelAdminLogEventsFilter can be used to filter out actions of a certain type, and the admins field can be used to show only actions by certain admins.
q can also be used to filter only logs matching a query string.

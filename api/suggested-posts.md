Subscribers are now able to submit content to their favorite channels as suggested posts through a transparent and automated interface: simply populate the suggested_post flag of messages.sendMessage (or any other message-sending related method) with a suggestedPost constructor, and send the message to the monoforum » associated with the channel.

In this context, the sender can only (optionally) populate the following flags of suggestedPost:

- price - To offer payment for the suggested post (posts can also be suggested for free, without setting this flag).

- If set and specified in Stars

- The price must range between stars_suggested_post_amount_min and stars_suggested_post_amount_max,

- Upon successful completion, the channel will get price*stars_suggested_post_commission_permille/1000 stars, see stars_suggested_post_commission_permille ».

- .

- If set and specified in nanotons (toncoin):

- The price must range between ton_suggested_post_amount_min and ton_suggested_post_amount_max.

- Upon successful completion, the channel will get price*ton_suggested_post_commission_permille/1000 nanotons, see ton_suggested_post_commission_permille ».

- schedule_date - To specify when should the message be posted (optional, can be omitted if the message can be posted at any time); in this case, upon approval, the post will be automatically scheduled ».

- The allowed range for this value, if specified, is between stars_suggested_post_future_min and stars_suggested_post_future_max seconds in the future.

The channel administrator (or the user, for posts suggested by the channel to the user; in any case, for paid suggested posts, it's always the user that pays the channel, never the other way around) can then choose to:

- Accept the suggested post by invoking messages.toggleSuggestedPostApproval, setting only peer, msg_id and optionally schedule_date, to modify the scheduling date.

- This will emit a messageActionSuggestedPostApproval service message in reply to the suggestion (if not deleted) with the schedule_date and price flags populated accordingly, and the reject flag not set.

- If the user's balance is too low for the suggested price, the message will not be scheduled/posted until enough stars are added to the user's balance, and a messageActionSuggestedPostApproval service message in reply to the suggestion (if not deleted) will be emitted with the balance_too_low and price flags populated, and the reject flag not set.

- Once more stars are added to the user's balance, whoever is in charge of approval must re-invoke messages.toggleSuggestedPostApproval.

- The channel will receive the payment (for paid suggested posts) after the post is live on the channel for the number of seconds specified in the stars_suggested_post_age_min client configuration parameter » (i.e. starting from when it's actually posted, not from when it's added to the schedule queue): if the post is deleted before the required amount of seconds have elapsed, a messageActionSuggestedPostRefund will be emitted with no flags set in reply to the suggestion (if not deleted).

- A messageActionSuggestedPostRefund with the payer_initiated flag set will also be emitted if the payer refunds the payment for the Stars that were used to pay for the post.

- If everything goes well, after the amount of time specified above has elapsed a messageActionSuggestedPostSuccess will be emitted.

- Request a modification to the price, to the contents of the message or the scheduling date, by replying to the message with the same message, tweaked as needed; it's mandatory to also pass the same or a modified suggestedPost constructor to suggested_post.

- In this case, it will be up to the receiver to accept, request a modification or reject the suggested post, using the same flow previously used by the channel administrator (in case of a further modification, it will be the channel's turn again, and so on).

- Note that the channel may also suggest a post to the user unprompted (i.e. without replying to a post suggested by the user).

- Reject the suggested post by invoking messages.toggleSuggestedPostApproval, setting only peer, msg_id, reject and optionally reject_comment, to specify a reason for the rejection.

- This will emit a messageActionSuggestedPostApproval service message in reply to the suggestion (if not deleted) with the rejected and reject_comment flags populated accordingly.

The accepted/rejected/schedule_date flags of an approved/rejected suggestedPost will be updated accordingly within the message history.

Once posted, the suggested channel post will have either the message.paid_suggested_post_stars or the message.paid_suggested_post_ton flag set, indicating that the specified post was a suggested post paid using Telegram Stars or toncoin (in nanotons).
